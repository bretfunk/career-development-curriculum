# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes:
      How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how?

Most of my themese were about ambition, work ethic and ability to process information.  Turing has really pushed me to the limit on these but I feel like I have handled it all pretty well and therefore I still agree with my top five themes.  

* How are you different today than when you first started at Turing? How are you stronger now than on day 1? How have you struggled? 

I am older than my classmates and have done a lot in my life (Navy, flight school, working on Congress, small business owner, living overseas almost all of the last five years) and so the difficulties of Turing are one of the big reasons I knew Turing was right for me, I seek out these experiences.  I personally believe that the best experiences are difficult experiences and Turing does a great job of making you feel like drowning but never actually letting you drown.  I enjoy the process very much and hope that it makes me stronger in the end.  

* Considering how you describe these themes, how do you want others to see you as you continue to progress through Turing?

I hope people see a hard worker that is very dedicated to problem solving.  I don't know how my team dynamics will go since we have only done one project but I hope people see someone reliable and someone who gets things done.  

* Even though your Turing story isn't finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How will this story end?

My goal is to learn as much as possible so that is my end goal.  I have already seen that Turing is good about teaching you how to learn on your own too, this is probably one of the best things I will learn at Turing because I believe to get the kind of job I am looking for it will require more than just what Turing gives, I believe I will have to learn a lot on my own too and the tools that Turing is giving me will hopefully make that process much easier. 

* Finally, write a draft of your story here. This is a short paragraph, 4-6 sentences, describing who you are, why you came to Turing, and what you hope to accomplish while you're here:

Bret Funk joined the Navy after High School and served in Iraq and Afghanistan launching airplanes off of aircraft carriers.  After the Navy, he went to flight school to prepare to be a fighter pilot.  In college, he got political and ended up working the U.S. Congress, in both the House and the Senate, for four years.  Afterwards he started his own company and traveled the world while working remotely.  During that time he met his beautiful girlfriend Daniela, and he still spends most of the year down in Ecuador.  After selling his business, he moved to Denver and went to the Turing school of software and design.  While he was there he learned alot about software development and about himself.  He build many projects at Turing that are very difficult and showed mastery of fundamential software development skills.
